# How to contribute

This project is FOSS (free and open source software), therefore, anyone interested to use it or to contribute is welcome.

* If you have a nice fast function that can be faster than an intrinsic within an "acceptable" tolerance.
* If you have an idea to make the code/documentation better looking and easier to read (we are striving for the [Fortran stdlib style guide](https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib/blob/HEAD/STYLE_GUIDE.md) but not there yet)
* If you have an idea to make the unit tests even more robust

Please go ahead and open a discussion or create a PR.

# Basic rules:
* Remember, this is an open-source project! So be gentle and patient (we know, it is all about fast functions, but for the sake of our intellectual curiosity and helping our work).
* Be polite, especially when disagreeing!
* Enjoy number crunching coding with Modern Fortran :)
